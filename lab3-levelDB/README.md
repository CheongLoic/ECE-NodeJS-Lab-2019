## About this work
In this lab, we use levelDB

Tasks :
- [x] Add a `get` function to `metrics` module
- [x] Add a route to get a metric (one of the metric, all the metrics)
- [x] Add a `delete` function to `metrics` module
- [ ] Add a route to delete a metric based on its key

Only id=loic has metrics
Go to http://localhost:8082/metrics/loic to show all his metrics
The route http://localhost:8082/metricsToDelete/loic doesn't work
