## About this work
In this lab, we use Express and Typescript instead of doing routing and server setup manually
Pages diplayed on the browser is the same than what there are at lab-2-express folder
However, the code changed in order to use Typescript (.js files converted to .ts files (metrics.js => metrics.ts))

Tasks :
- [x] /home page with description
- [x] /hello page with the button and AJAX request for obtaining metrics


## Run instructions
After you cloned the repository and redirected to the folder lab-2-typescript, execute those commands :
``` 
npm install 
npm run build
npm start
```
Then open a browser with the link below http://localhost:8080/
